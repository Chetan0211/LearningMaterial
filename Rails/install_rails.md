# Install rails

Before going through below steps, complete the steps for [installing ruby](./../Ruby/install_ruby.md).

Once you install ruby all you need to do is install rails.
```bash
gem install rails -v 7.2.1
```

That's it rails is installed in your system. Make sure you have installed the database you are going to be used(like installing MySQL or installing Postgres).
