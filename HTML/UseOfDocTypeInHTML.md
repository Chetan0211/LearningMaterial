# Use of <!DOCTYPE> in HTML

This is the 1st line of code we type while writing HTML. So the main use of this is to specify the browser in which rendering mode is used for the document.

<!DOCTYPE html> works from HTML5. This is supported in all browsers.

DOCTYPE is not a case-sensitive one. So we can specify in different ways:

<!Doctype html>

<!doctype html>

<!DocType html>

All the above-mentioned things can be used.
