# What is Node JS?

Node JS is a open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing Javascript code outside the browser. Node JS is **NOT** a framework or programming language.

Normally node JS is used to create backend servers.

### Advantages of Node JS:

1. **Easy Scalability**: Developers prefer to use Node.js because it is easily scaling the application in both horizontal and vertical directions. We can also add extra resources during the scalability of the application.

2. **Real-time web apps**: If you are building a web app you can also use PHP, and it will take the same amount of time when you use Node.js, But if I am talking about building chat apps or gaming apps Node.js is much more preferable because of faster synchronization. Also, the event loop avoids HTTP overloaded for Node.js development.
 
3. **Fast Suite**: NodeJs runs on the V8 engine developed by Google. Event loop in NodeJs handles all asynchronous operation so NodeJs acts like a fast suite and all the operations can be done quickly like reading or writing in the database, network connection, or file system
Easy to learn and code: NodeJs is easy to learn and code because it uses JavaScript. If you are a front-end developer and have a good grasp of JavaScript you can easily learn and build the application on NodeJS

4. **Advantage of Caching**: It provides the caching of a single module. Whenever there is any request for the first module, it gets cached in the application memory, so you donâ€™t need to re-execute the code.
Data Streaming: In NodeJs HTTP request and response are considered as two separate events. They are data stream so when you process a file at the time of loading it will reduce the overall time and will make it faster when the data is presented in the form of transmissions. It also allows you to stream audio and video files at lightning speed.

5. **Hosting**: PaaS (Platform as a Service) and Heroku are the hosting platforms for NodeJS application deployment which is easy to use without facing any issue.
6. **Corporate Support**: Most of the well-known companies like Walmart, Paypal, Microsoft, Yahoo are using NodeJS for building the applications. NodeJS uses JavaScript, so most of the companies are combining front-end and backend Teams together into a single unit.
